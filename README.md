## kl-emacs

This is my personal `~/.emacs.d/` setup, excluding packages installed via MELPA and my autosave and backup directories (see `init.el` for more about that).

To use this yourself, just clone the repository into `~/.emacs.d` and go to town. You'll be missing some packages and fonts, probably.
